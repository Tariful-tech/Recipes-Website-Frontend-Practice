     Maacher kalia or maacher jhol is a simple Bengali fish curry that is a favorite in many Indian families. Maacher means "fish" and kalia or jhol means "in curry or gravy." The most commonly used fish to prepare this dish is a type of freshwater carp or rui maach.If you do not have access to rui maach, you also can use salmon, pomfret, sea bass, red snapper, tilapia, or catfish. I like it because it is a traditional food in our culture. </p>
